# Pandamonium-3D-Platformer


The project I will be working on is a 3D platformer called Pandamonium. Pandamonium a 3D platformer where you take on the role of a red panda travelling through time. The game starts off in a zoo where your job is to reach the end of the level. On your journey you will face different challenges, such as different types of obstacles as well as enemies that will try to stop you in your tracks. Moreover, throughout your journey you will find different collectables.


## Aims 
6.Aims (max. 100 words): A statement of the overall aims of the project.
The aim of this project is to produce a polished game level of a 3D platformer. The level will contain different gameplay mechanics, such as enemies, movement elements. This project aims to demonstrate gameplay and level design using Unreal Engine’s visual scripting. The final deliverable will serve as an introduction to what the full game would be. 

## Objectives
Must Have: 
Input: Mouse and Keyboard support
Implement Core Gameplay Mechanics: Movement and Collectables, Pick-Ups
Enemy AI: Create simple enemy AI, 2 or 3 different enemies within the level.
Level: I would like to create a single level which introduces the player to the basic mechanics.
Collectables: I would like to create pick-ups and collectables in the level as a form of progression.
3D models: I would like to make a variety of 3D models, these range from the player to the enemies as well as the props that could be found throughout the level.
Should Have: 
Audio: Implement a variety of sound effects.
Checkpoint System: I would like to implement a checkpoint system that will return the player to a specific point in the level if they were to die in the game.
UI: I would like to create a simple GUI that displays how many collectables you have obtained in the level. On top of that I would like to create a simple menu screen which allows the player to adjust settings and play the game.
Could have:
Animation: Animation is something I would like to include as I know for a fact that it would make the game feel more like a game. If I have the time I would like to make my own animations, however if that doesn’t seem feasible then I will use premade animations (Mixamo)
Bonus levels and Hub:
My game idea revolves around the game consisting of several levels as well as a hub. I realise that this may be a lot to tackle, however if I have the time I would like to create several short, polished levels as well as a hub area for the player to walk around in and have it function as the level selection menu.
Controller Support: For the time being I would like to focus on having mouse and keyboard support, however this is very low priority and I will consider adding it if I have the time.
